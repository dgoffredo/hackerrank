I don't know how to do anything. Let's fix that.

Why
---
Practice!

What
----
These are my attempts at problems available on [hackerrank](hackerrank.com).
Each directory within this repository is a "challenge" named according to
how it appears in the relevant URL, e.g.
[determining-dna-health](determining-dna-health) refers to the problem
described in https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/determining-dna-health.
